# # Fine-tuning a Pretrained Network for Style Recognition
# 
# In this example, we'll explore a common approach that is particularly useful in real-world applications: take a pre-trained Caffe network and fine-tune the parameters on your custom data.
# 
# The advantage of this approach is that, since pre-trained networks are learned on a large set of images, the intermediate layers capture the "semantics" of the general visual appearance. Think of it as a very powerful generic visual feature that you can treat as a black box. On top of that, only a relatively small amount of data is needed for good performance on the target task.

# First, we will need to prepare the data. This involves the following parts:
# (1) Get the ImageNet ilsvrc pretrained model with the provided shell scripts.
# (2) Download a subset of the overall Flickr style dataset for this demo.
# (3) Compile the downloaded Flickr dataset into a database that Caffe can then consume.

For other images, the predictions won't be this good, sometimes due to the network actually failing to recognize the object(s) present in the image, but perhaps even more often due to the fact that not all images contain an object from the (somewhat arbitrarily chosen) 1000 ImageNet categories.

# ### 4. End-to-end finetuning for style
# 
# Finally, we'll train both nets again, starting from the weights we just learned.  The only difference this time is that we'll be learning the weights "end-to-end" by turning on learning in *all* layers of the network, starting from the RGB `conv1` filters directly applied to the input image.  We pass the argument `learn_all=True` to the `style_net` function defined earlier in this notebook, which tells the function to apply a positive (non-zero) `lr_mult` value for all parameters.  Under the default, `learn_all=False`, all parameters in the pretrained layers (`conv1` through `fc7`) are frozen (`lr_mult = 0`), and we learn only the classifier layer `fc8_flickr`.
# 
# Note that both networks start at roughly the accuracy achieved at the end of the previous training session, and improve significantly with end-to-end training.  To be more scientific, we'd also want to follow the same additional training procedure *without* the end-to-end training, to ensure that our results aren't better simply because we trained for twice as long.  Feel free to try this yourself!

Since all layers have been optimized for the style recognition task at hand, we expect both nets to get better results than the ones above, which were achieved by nets with only their classifier layers trained for the style task (on top of either ImageNet pretrained or randomly initialized weights).

# We can also look at the predictions of the network trained from scratch.  We see that in this case, the scratch network also predicts the correct label for the image (*Pastel*), but is much less confident in its prediction than the pretrained net.

# So we did finetuning and it is awesome. Let's take a look at what kind of results we are able to get with a longer, more complete run of the style recognition dataset. Note: the below URL might be occasionally down because it is run on a research machine.
